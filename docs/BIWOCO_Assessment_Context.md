Dear Bang,

Thank you for participating in the initial interview for the AI-Native Full Stack Developer position at BIWOCO. We are impressed by your background and experience, and would like to invite you to the next step in our interview process, which is the technical assessment.
This exercise is designed to give us a better understanding of your skills and approach to problem-solving.

1. Context
You’re joining a brand‑new project. We have complete product overview requirements and visual designs, but implementation details aren’t finalized. You will be the only developer, working closely with 1 BA and 1 Designer. Timeline is aggressive - we need to ship a usable slice very soon.

You have full access to AI tools (coding copilots, code‑gen, agents, doc/chat LLMs, vector DBs, test‑gen, diagramming, prompt orchestration, etc.) and any standard dev tools.

Your task is to show how you’d think, plan, and execute as an AI‑native, “vibe‑coding” full‑stack engineer who can move from idea → plan → working software with tight feedback loops.

2. Mission

    Explain your approach to deliver fast with quality using AI at every step.
    Implement a thin but end‑to‑end vertical slice from UI → API → DB → background job → AI feature → telemetry, aligned to the provided designs.
    Demonstrate AI‑native development: prompt engineering, code generation, refactors, test scaffolding, and auto‑documentation.

3. Key Points

    Explains the mission details: what you will do and why
    Outlines your vision solution: the overall end-to-end design and approach
    Describes your AI-native workflow: how you would leverage AI in each stage (design, coding, testing, documentation)
    Suggests next steps: how you would extend or optimize the solution with more time
    The final submission is about your plan and solution vision, not step-by-step coding details
    Time Frame: Please complete the assessment within 7 days of receiving this email

We appreciate your continued interest in BIWOCO and look forward to reviewing your submission.

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.

Happy Coding,

Best regards,
Dulcie Nguyen
